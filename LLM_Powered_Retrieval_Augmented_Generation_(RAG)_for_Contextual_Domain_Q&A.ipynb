    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Why This Approach?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **No LangChain, No LlamaIndex** — everything is implemented manually for **full transparency and control**\n",
    "*  Enables **modular customization** and **fine-grained experimentation** for research or production use\n",

    "6. **Prompt Augmentation**: Construct a query-specific prompt by injecting the top relevant text chunks\n",
    "7. **Local LLM Generation**: Load an **instruction-tuned LLM** (e.g., `Gemma-7B-it`) to generate accurate, grounded answers\n",
    "8. **Evaluation (Optional)**: Use BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore for answer quality assessment\n",

    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It’s a method introduced in the paper titled “Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.” The core idea behind RAG is to enhance the performance of generative language models by giving them access to external knowledge sources during inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of relying purely on what a language model has memorized during training, RAG enables the model to first retrieve relevant information related to the user query from an external corpus or database. Once that information is retrieved, it becomes part of the model’s input. The model then uses this retrieved context to generate more accurate and factually grounded responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is especially useful for knowledge-intensive tasks like question answering, where it's important to provide up-to-date or document-specific information. By retrieving relevant chunks and incorporating them into the prompt, the model doesn't need to remember everything—it simply needs to reason effectively based on what it’s given at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, RAG brings together the best of two worlds: the precision of information retrieval systems and the flexibility of generative models. This combination leads to better factual correctness, improved explainability, and greater adaptability to new domains or documents.\n"

    "## Why Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of using RAG is to enhance the **factual accuracy**, **reliability**, and **interpretability** of answers generated by large language models (LLMs), by grounding their outputs in external information sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits of RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reduces hallucination**\n",
    "RAG minimizes the risk of hallucinated content by incorporating real, contextually relevant information retrieved from external documents into the LLM’s prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improves transparency and traceability**\n",
    "RAG makes it possible to see *where* the information in a response came from. Even if the generation is imperfect, the user has direct visibility into the supporting context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customizes LLMs without retraining**\n",
    "Instead of retraining or fine-tuning an LLM on domain-specific data, RAG allows retrieval from custom corpora (e.g., medical textbooks, legal docs, internal reports), making the system adaptable without changing the model weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enhances factual alignment with the prompt**\n",
    "By grounding generation in retrieved content, RAG ensures that the model’s output stays closer to the truth and is better aligned with the original user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maintains interpretability and control**\n",
    "Because the source context is visible, RAG-based systems are easier to debug, audit, and trust — especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare, legal, and enterprise search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enables fast iteration**\n",
    "RAG allows updates to system behavior by modifying or expanding the document corpus, without the need for costly retraining. This leads to faster iteration and more agile deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is particularly effective in use cases where **domain knowledge**, **explainability**, and **real-time updates** are critical:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Domain-specific question answering (e.g., medical, legal, technical)\n",
    "* Educational tutoring systems grounded in textbooks\n",
    "* Internal enterprise assistants trained on company documents\n",
    "* Customer support systems that pull from knowledge bases or manuals\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a **modular, efficient, and transparent alternative to model fine-tuning**, making it a powerful technique for building reliable AI assistants grounded in real data.\n"

    "## What kind of problems can RAG be used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is useful in any scenario where we have domain-specific or proprietary information that likely wasn't part of an LLM’s original training data. This makes it ideal for working with private datasets or structured knowledge bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few practical use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Support Q&A Systems**  \n",
    "  You can treat your existing help docs or support FAQs as a knowledge base. When a customer asks a question, the RAG system retrieves relevant documentation snippets and lets the LLM turn them into a helpful, natural-sounding response. Klarna, for example, uses a similar setup to handle two-thirds of their customer support chats—saving nearly $40 million in the first month.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Email Thread Summarization and Analysis**  \n",
    "  In industries like insurance, where lengthy email chains between agents and clients are common, RAG can retrieve key parts of the conversation and use an LLM to generate a concise, structured summary—saving time and improving productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Internal Knowledge Chatbots**  \n",
    "  Many large companies struggle with siloed information across internal documents. A RAG system can index internal wikis, policies, onboarding documents, or dev guides, and help employees get quick, source-grounded answers. Even better, it includes links or references so people can verify or explore further if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Educational Q&A with Textbooks**  \n",
    "  Studying with thick textbooks? A RAG setup can find the relevant textbook passages and provide natural explanations to your questions, along with the original context in case you want to read more deeply.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all of these, the key idea is the same: retrieve trusted information and let the LLM translate it into a human-friendly answer. In a way, an LLM in a RAG system becomes a kind of \"word calculator\"—operating over retrieved chunks instead of numbers.\n"

    "## Why run RAG locally?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main reasons: **privacy**, **speed**, and **cost**. Running your own RAG pipeline locally—on your own hardware—can offer several major benefits over relying on cloud-based APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Privacy: Your data never leaves your machine**  \n",
    "  When using public or commercial APIs (like OpenAI or Google Cloud), any data you send for inference travels over the internet to a third-party server. This can raise concerns if you're dealing with:\n",
    "  - Personal health records (medical)\n",
    "  - Company-internal documents (HR, legal, engineering)\n",
    "  - Client-sensitive data (banking, insurance)  \n",
    "  A local setup ensures full control—no data transmission beyond your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Speed: No API queues, no rate limits**  \n",
    "  Cloud APIs are sometimes slow due to:\n",
    "  - Shared infrastructure load\n",
    "  - Rate limits for your account tier\n",
    "  - Network latency  \n",
    "  When running locally, inference speed depends entirely on your system's capabilities (GPU/CPU and RAM). There's no queue, so you get consistent response times—especially useful for batch jobs or high-frequency queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost: One-time setup, zero recurring fees**  \n",
    "  API-based models charge per request or token (e.g., $0.03 per 1K tokens), which can add up quickly in enterprise-scale deployments or high-traffic apps. Local models might need:\n",
    "  - One-time investment in a good GPU machine (e.g., RTX 3060, 3090, A100 etc.)\n",
    "  - Occasional power/electricity cost  \n",
    "  But after that, there's no per-query cost—making local RAG ideal for long-term or large-volume usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Control: Full transparency and flexibility**  \n",
    "  Running locally means you can:\n",
    "  - Inspect every part of the pipeline (retrieval, reranking, generation)\n",
    "  - Swap out components easily (e.g., change the embedding model, switch LLMs)\n",
    "  - Fine-tune models if needed  \n",
    "  This level of customization is crucial for research, compliance, or performance optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Emerging performance parity**  \n",
    "  While commercial APIs still outperform open-source models in many general use cases, smaller domain-specific open-source models (like Mistral, Phi-2, TinyLlama) are catching up. With smart retrieval and prompt design, they often **outperform bigger LLMs** on targeted tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, a local RAG pipeline might take a bit more effort to set up—but the trade-offs are often worth it depending on your goals.\n"

    "## Key Terms in RAG and LLM Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some important concepts you'll encounter when building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system or working with large language models in general. These terms help understand how each component of the pipeline works and why it's necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Token**  \n",
    "A token is a basic unit of text that a language model understands. It could be:\n",
    "- A full word (e.g., \"hello\")\n",
    "- A piece of a word (e.g., \"ing\" or \"tion\")\n",
    "- A punctuation mark (e.g., \",\" or \"!\")  \n",
    "In English, 1 token is roughly equivalent to 4 characters, and 100 tokens are about 75 words. Language models break input text into tokens before processing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding**  \n",
    "An embedding is a numerical vector representation of text (or other data types like images or audio). These vectors are typically high-dimensional (e.g., 768 values long) and are learned in such a way that similar meanings produce similar vectors.  \n",
    "For example, the sentences *\"The cat is sleeping\"* and *\"A feline is napping\"* would ideally have embeddings that are close in vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding Model**  \n",
    "This is the model responsible for generating embeddings. It takes raw input (like text) and outputs a vector representation.  \n",
    "Unlike a generative LLM, an embedding model is trained specifically to preserve **semantic similarity** in vector form. You might use models like Sentence-BERT or MiniLM for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Similarity Search (Vector Search)**  \n",
    "Once you have embeddings, similarity search allows you to find vectors that are close to each other in space.  \n",
    "This is how retrieval works in a RAG system:  \n",
    "- Your query is embedded into a vector  \n",
    "- That vector is compared to stored vectors (from documents, PDFs, etc.)  \n",
    "- The most similar ones are selected  \n",
    "Common similarity measures include **cosine similarity** and **dot product**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Large Language Model (LLM)**  \n",
    "A large language model is trained to learn patterns in language. It can:\n",
    "- Understand a prompt\n",
    "- Predict the most likely continuation  \n",
    "Generative LLMs are especially good at producing coherent text given an input.  \n",
    "For example, given the prompt *\"The capital of France is\"*, a well-trained LLM would likely generate *\"Paris.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM Context Window**  \n",
    "This is the maximum number of tokens a model can accept as input.  \n",
    "As of 2024:\n",
    "- GPT-4 supports 32k to 128k tokens (about 96 to 384 pages of text)\n",
    "- Gemma (open-source) supports 8,192 tokens (about 24 pages)  \n",
    "A larger context window allows a model to \"see\" more information at once, which is particularly useful in RAG systems where multiple documents may be passed as context.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt**  \n",
    "A prompt is the input provided to a generative LLM. It guides the model on what to generate.  \n",
    "Prompt design can dramatically impact performance. This has led to the practice of **prompt engineering**, where prompts are carefully structured to get optimal outputs.  \n",
    "Prompts can include:\n",
    "- System instructions (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant.\")\n",
    "- Few-shot examples (e.g., query-answer pairs)\n",
    "- Contextual data (e.g., retrieved documents in RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to give the model all the right signals so that it can produce meaningful, accurate responses.\n"

    "1. Open a PDF document (you could use almost any PDF here).\n",
    "2. Format the text of the PDF textbook ready for an embedding model (this process is known as text splitting/chunking).\n",

    "4. Build a retrieval system that uses vector search to find relevant chunks of text based on a query.\n",
    "5. Create a prompt that incorporates the retrieved pieces of text.\n",
    "6. Generate an answer to a query based on passages from the textbook.\n",

Basically, they are hydrated carbons. The word “carbo” means  carbon and “hydrate” means water. Glucose, the most abundant  carbohydrate in the human body, has six carbon atoms, twelve  hydrogen atoms, and six oxygen atoms. The chemical formula for  glucose is written as C6H12O6.

Why then, does the water not flow from blood  plasma to cells? The force of water also known as hydrostatic  pressure  maintains  the  volumes  of  water  between  fluid  compartments against the force of all dissolved substances. The  concentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water.  (Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between  the intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration  of all dissolved substances is equal.)  The force driving the water movement through the selectively  permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the  one side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a  selectively permeable membrane exert a force, called osmotic  pressure. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared  to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the  water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing  more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the  pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net  water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an  equal rate).  One equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different  volumes is the following  5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L =  5g/L)  The differences in concentrations of particular substances  provide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work.

For example, dental problems can lead to difficulties  with chewing and swallowing, which in turn can make it hard to  maintain a healthy diet. The use of dentures or the preparation of  pureed or chopped foods can help solve this problem. There also  is a decreased thirst response in the elderly, and the kidneys have  a decreased ability to concentrate urine, both of which can lead to  dehydration.  Sensory Issues  At about age sixty, taste buds begin to decrease in size and number.  As a result, the taste threshold is higher in older adults, meaning  that more of the same flavor must be present to detect the taste.  Many elderly people lose the ability to distinguish between salty,  sour, sweet, and bitter flavors. This can make food seem less  appealing and decrease the appetite. An intake of foods high in  sugar and sodium can increase due to an inability to discern those  tastes. The sense of smell also decreases, which impacts attitudes  toward food. Sensory issues may also affect the digestion because  the taste and smell of food stimulates the secretion of  digestive\\u00a0enzymes in the mouth, stomach, and pancreas.  Dysphagia  Some older adults have difficulty getting adequate nutrition  because of the disorder dysphagia, which impairs the ability to  swallow. Any damage to the parts of the brain that control  swallowing can result in dysphagia, therefore stroke is a common  cause. Dysphagia is also associated with advanced dementia  because of overall brain function impairment. To assist older adults  suffering from dysphagia, it can be helpful to alter food consistency.

    "### Further text processing (splitting pages into sentences)\n",
    "\n",
    "When preparing text for embedding, the way we split and chunk the content can have a big impact on the quality of retrieval and generation. There’s still a lot of research going on in this area, but a practical and effective method is to split long texts into smaller chunks based on sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of embedding an entire page or paragraph at once, it’s often better to break the content into smaller groups — for example, chunks containing 5, 7, or 10 sentences. These numbers aren’t fixed; they can be tuned based on the dataset and the kind of answers we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the high-level workflow looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ingest text → Split into chunks → Embed chunks → Use embeddings for retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of ways to split the text into sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use simple rules, like splitting on punctuation (e.g., `text.split(\". \")`). This works okay in clean cases but can miss edge cases like abbreviations or quotes.\n",
    "2. Use an NLP library like spaCy or NLTK, which uses pre-trained models to identify sentence boundaries more accurately. These tools are generally better at handling messy or complex text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason to split into sentences (and sentence groups) is to make the chunks easier to handle — especially for embedding models with token limits. It also helps the retrieval system find more focused, relevant pieces of information. For example, when a query is run, we can identify exactly which sentence group helped generate the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, we’ll use `spaCy` because it tends to be more robust than simple string splitting. It’s also fast and well-suited to preprocessing large amounts of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t have it already, you can follow spaCy’s [installation guide](https://spacy.io/usage) to get started.\n"

    "\n",
    "Now that we’ve broken down our PDF text into individual sentences, the next step is to organize those sentences into manageable groups, or what we often call **chunks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of breaking text into smaller parts is referred to as chunking.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why is chunking necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few good reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It’s easier to manage and compare chunks that are relatively similar in size. Embedding models work more consistently when the inputs aren’t too variable.\n",
    "- Embedding models have a token limit. For example, if the model we’re using has a limit of 384 tokens, any chunk longer than that may be truncated, meaning we might lose important information.\n",
    "- Generative models (LLMs) also have context window limits. Feeding them compact, well-formed chunks of relevant information helps us make better use of that context space without wasting tokens or overloading the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many strategies being explored in current research to decide how to chunk information effectively. Some use sentence boundaries, some use overlapping windows, and others use token-based or semantic methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we’ll stick with a simple and intuitive approach — grouping the text into fixed-sized blocks of 10 sentences per chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why 10?\n",
    "\n",
    "After analyzing our data, we found that on average, each page had around 10 sentences and around 287 tokens. So by grouping sentences in blocks of 10, we typically stay well below the embedding model’s token limit (which in our case is 384 for `all-mpnet-base-v2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup provides a good balance: chunks are short enough to fit into the model, but still long enough to provide meaningful context when retrieved later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we’ll write a function that takes a list of sentences and splits them into smaller groups of 10 or fewer. This will allow us to prepare the data for embedding efficiently.\n"

However, the CDC estimates that about seventy-six million people in the United States become ill from foodborne pathogens or other agents every year. In North America, a number of government agencies work to educate the public about food infections and intoxications, prevent the spread of disease, and quell any major problems or outbreaks. They include the CDC, the FDA, and the USDA, among other organizations. Efforts on the Governmental Level A number of government agencies work to ensure food safety and to protect the public from foodborne illness. Food regulatory agencies work to protect the consumer and ensure the safety of our food. Food and drug regulation in the United States began in the late nineteenth century when state and local governments began to enact regulatory policies. In 1906, Congress passed the Pure Food and Drugs Act, which led to the creation of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Today, a number of agencies are in charge of monitoring how food is produced, processed, and packaged.1 1.\\xa0History of Food and Drug Regulation in the United States. (',\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we’ve chunked our text into smaller, manageable groups of sentences, the next step is to convert these chunks into something machines can understand: **numbers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **embeddings** come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "An embedding is a **useful numerical representation** of text — a way to turn a chunk of language into a vector (a list of numbers) that captures its meaning. If two texts have similar meaning, their embeddings will be close together in a mathematical space called **embedding space**, even if the actual words used are completely different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern embeddings are **learned representations**, meaning the model has been trained on massive amounts of data to understand how words and sentences relate to one another. Unlike static mappings like `\"apple\" → 1` and `\"banana\" → 2`, these embeddings are context-aware — so `\"puppy\"` and `\"dog\"` are placed closer in vector space because of their semantic similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern NLP models also don't operate on full words alone — they use **tokens**, which are often subwords or even characters. These are generated by tokenization methods like **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** or **SentencePiece**, making it easier for models to generalize over different inputs.\n",

Therefore, reversing or improving these factors by lifestyle interventions markedly improve the overall health of Type 2 diabetics and lower blood-glucose levels. In fact it has been shown that when people are overweight, losing as little as nine pounds (four kilograms) decreases blood- glucose levels in Type 2 diabetics. The Diabetes Prevention Trial demonstrated that by adhering to a diet containing between 1,200 and 1,800 kilocalories per day with a dietary fat intake goal of less than 25 percent and increasing physical activity to at least 150 minutes per week, people at high risk for Type 2 diabetes achieved a weight loss of 7 percent and significantly decreased their chances of developing Type 2 diabetes.15 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has a website that provides information and tips for helping diabetics answer the question, \\u201cWhat Can I Eat\\u201d. In regard to carbohydrates the ADA recommends diabetics keep track of the carbohydrates they eat and set a limit. These dietary practices will help keep blood-glucose levels in the target range.

It attracts and holds onto fat while it is simultaneously attracted to and held on to by water. Emulsification increases the surface area of lipids over a thousand- fold, making them more accessible to the digestive enzymes. Once the stomach contents have been emulsified, fat-breaking enzymes work on the triglycerides and diglycerides to sever fatty acids from their glycerol foundations. As pancreatic lipase enters the small intestine, it breaks down the fats into free fatty acids and monoglycerides. Yet again, another hurdle presents itself. How will the fats pass through the watery layer of mucus that coats the absorptive lining of the digestive tract?As before, the answer is bile. Bile salts envelop the fatty acids and monoglycerides to form micelles. Micelles have a fatty acid core with a water-soluble exterior.\",\n          \"Image by\\u00a0Gtirouflet / CC BY-SA 3.0 dense cortical bone is about 10 percent porous and it looks like many concentric circles, similar to the rings in a tree trunk, sandwiched together (Figure 2.27 \\u201cCortical (Compact) Bone\\u201d).

    "##  2. RAG — Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Search and Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a moment to deeply understand what RAG really means.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RAG** stands for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**, a powerful framework that combines two core strengths:\n",
    "- The **precision** of search systems (retrieval)\n",
    "- The **fluency** of generative models (LLMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  What Does RAG Do?\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, RAG answers questions by first **retrieving the most relevant information**, and then **generating a response** based on that information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of relying purely on what the LLM “remembers” from pretraining (which may be outdated or hallucinated), RAG allows us to inject **custom, factual, and current knowledge** into the generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  RAG Step-by-Step\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a breakdown of the RAG workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Step | Description |\n",
    "|------|-------------|\n",
    "|  **Retrieval** | Search and fetch relevant context chunks from your document corpus, based on a given query. |\n",
    "|  **Augmentation** | Feed those retrieved chunks into the LLM as part of the prompt. This adds **external grounding** to the LLM's generation process. |\n",
    "|  **Generation** | The LLM generates a coherent and fluent answer **based on the augmented context**. This makes the output more factual and traceable. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Why Is RAG Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard LLMs are trained to \"sound right\", not always to \"be right\". This makes them prone to hallucination.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG adds **domain knowledge and factual grounding** into the loop:\n",
    "- You control the source data\n",
    "- You trace where answers come from\n",
    "- You improve factual accuracy, transparency, and trust\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Real-World Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is powerful in any situation where **question answering over private or domain-specific knowledge** is needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Knowledge Bases** → Answer questions using internal documentation\n",
    "-  **Customer Support** → Automatically respond to queries using support logs or FAQs\n",
    "-  **Legal & Insurance** → Navigate through large email chains, policies, or contracts\n",
    "- **Scientific Research** → Search and summarize domain papers or lab notes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Analogy: LLMs as Calculators for Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a Large Language Model as a **calculator for words**. But just like a calculator, it’s only as useful as the **input you give it**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Similarity search — also known as **semantic search**, **vector search**, or more recently, **hybrid retrieval** — is the idea of searching not by exact keywords, but by **meaning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With traditional keyword-based search, you're looking for **exact string matches**.\n",
    "> Example: Searching `\"apple\"` returns results that contain the word `\"apple\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But with **semantic search**, you're looking for **similar ideas or concepts**, even if the exact words don’t match.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: Searching `\"macronutrients function\"` might return a chunk like:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> *\"There are three classes of macronutrients: carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically processed into cellular energy... allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the phrase `\"macronutrients function\"` may not appear in the text, the **meaning** matches — and that’s what semantic search is all about.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  How Does It Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood:\n",
    "- Each document chunk is represented as a **dense embedding vector** using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model.\n",
    "- The **user query** is also converted into a dense vector using the same model.\n",
    "- We use **FAISS** to compare the query vector with all stored vectors and **find the most semantically similar chunks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a search method that’s based on **meaning**, not just word overlap — and it’s surprisingly good at picking up on context, intent, and topic similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  What Makes This a Hybrid Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses a **dense vector retrieval method** — powered by:\n",
    "- **SentenceTransformers** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to embed text\n",
    "- **FAISS** (`IndexFlatL2`) to perform similarity search using L2 distance\n",
    "\n",
    "You can further enhance this by incorporating:\n",
    "- **Sparse retrieval** (e.g., BM25/TF-IDF)\n",
    "- **Hybrid retrieval**: Combining sparse and dense scores for better recall and precision\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we focus on the dense retrieval pipeline — it’s lightweight, powerful, and performs well even with small to medium-scale datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Workflow Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s now perform semantic search over our textbook/document data:\n",
    "1. Load the **precomputed embeddings** (generated earlier using MiniLM)\n",
    "2. Load the **FAISS index** containing all chunk vectors\n",
    "3. Convert the **user query** to an embedding using the same model\n",
    "4. Use FAISS to find the **top-k most semantically similar chunks**\n",
    "5. Display the retrieved chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **retrieval core** of a RAG pipeline: smart, fast, and grounded in meaning rather than just keywords.\n",

The Diabetes Prevention Trial demonstrated that by adhering to a diet containing between 1,200 and 1,800 kilocalories per day with a dietary fat intake goal of less than 25 percent and increasing physical activity to at least 150 minutes per week, people at high risk for Type 2 diabetes achieved a weight loss of 7 percent and significantly decreased their chances of developing Type 2 diabetes.15 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has a website that provides information and tips for helping diabetics answer the question, \\u201cWhat Can I Eat\\u201d.

    "\n",
    "Our embedding model is ready to go — now it's time to **search by meaning**, not just by words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you're studying a topic like **macronutrients** and want to search your textbook for **\"macronutrients functions\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a semantic search setup, we don't need the exact phrase to appear in the document — instead, we look for chunks that have **similar meaning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how we do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define your query**\n",
    "   Start by creating a query string, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \"macronutrients functions\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This query could be a word, a phrase, or even a full question.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embed the query**\n",
    "   Use the same embedding model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to convert your query into a vector, just like you did with your document chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute similarity scores**\n",
    "   Compare the query vector with each of the document chunk vectors. FAISS handles this for us using a distance-based similarity function.\n",
    "   In this notebook, we are using **L2 distance** (Euclidean distance). A **smaller distance** means **higher similarity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sort and retrieve top matches**\n",
    "   FAISS will return the indices of the most similar chunks. You can then use these indices to retrieve the original chunks of text from your list. These are your most relevant passages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This search method lets us **match based on meaning**, not just matching the same words.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the query `\"macronutrients functions\"` might return a paragraph like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"There are three classes of macronutrients: carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients comes from their chemical bonds...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the exact words aren't in the text, the model understands the meaning and finds a relevant match.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how **retrieval** works in a RAG pipeline:\n",
    "We take a query, embed it, compare it with the embedded knowledge base, and retrieve the most relevant chunks — all grounded in semantic similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s now walk through the code that performs this end-to-end retrieval using FAISS.\n"

    "Before we move on to augmentation and generation, let’s take a quick detour to understand the different **similarity measures** used to compare embeddings. This will help us better interpret what’s happening under the hood when we calculate how \"close\" two chunks of text are in embedding space.\n"

    "| **Cosine Similarity** | Measures the angle (directional similarity) between two vectors, independent of magnitude. Values range from -1 (opposite) to 1 (same). | Ideal for semantic comparison of text when embeddings are not pre-normalized.                  | `torch.nn.functional.cosine_similarity`, `sentence_transformers.util.cos_sim` |\n",
    "\n",
    "In **semantic search**, cosine similarity is often preferred — it compares meaning rather than raw size. However, since many embedding models, including `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, output **L2-normalized embeddings by default**, **dot product and cosine similarity give the same result**.\n",

    "* The outputs are already normalized.\n",
    "* Therefore, **we can use dot product as a fast and accurate similarity measure**.\n",
    "* FAISS handles this efficiently with exact search using `IndexFlatL2` or other advanced ANN indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can apply these similarity concepts not just to text embeddings, but to **any embedding space** — images, audio, even cross-modal embeddings like in CLIP models (text ↔ image).\n",
    "\n",
    "Up next, we’ll compare a few vectors using both methods, then choose the right one for our RAG pipeline.\n"

    "Let’s analyze actual results from comparing a few vectors using dot product and cosine similarity. These vectors represent high-dimensional embeddings (in our case, size 384), and are normalized since we're using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model.\n",

Although awareness of orthorexia nervosa is increasing, it is not formally recognized in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual and thus it is difficult to get an estimate of how many persons are affected by orthorexia nervosa. Additionally, the lack of formal diagnostic criteria makes it impossible to know if orthorexia nervosa occurs with other types of existing disorders like anorexia or a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or if it’s a stand-alone eating disorder. Studies show that many persons with orthorexia nervosa also have OCD. Many experts view orthorexia nervosa as a variety of anorexia or OCD. Treatment usually involves psychotherapy and weight restoration as needed.11 OCD may be a consequence of malnutrition, being underweight and a starved brain thus weight restoration may resolve the OCD. Warning signs and symptoms of orthorexia nervosa:12 • Compulsive checking of ingredients lists and nutritional labels • An increased concern about the health of ingredients • Cutting out an increasing number of food groups such as all sugars, all carbohydrates, all dairy or all animal products • An inability to eat anything but a narrow group of foods that are deemed ‘healthy’ or ‘pure’ 11. Orthorexia.

Secondary signs and symptoms include gastric reflux, severe erosion of tooth enamel, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, lacerations in the mouth from vomiting, and peptic ulcers. Repeated damage to the esophagus puts people with bulimia at an increased risk for esophageal cancer. The disorder is also highly genetic, linked to depression and anxiety disorders, and most commonly occurs in adolescent girls and young women. Treatment often involves antidepressant medications and, like anorexia, has better results when both the family and the individual with the disorder participate in nutritional and psychiatric counseling. Binge-Eating Disorder Similar to those who experience anorexia and bulimia, people who have a binge-eating disorder have lost control over their eating. Binge-eating disorder is not currently diagnosed as a distinct psychiatric illness, although there is a proposal from the American Psychiatric Association to categorize it more specifically. People with binge-eating disorder will periodically overeat to the extreme, but their loss of control over eating is not followed by fasting, purging, or compulsive exercise. As a result, people with this disorder are often overweight or obese, and their chronic disease risks are those linked to having an abnormally high body weight such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and Type 2 diabetes. Additionally, they often experience guilt, shame, and depression.\n",

Similarly, depletion of B vitamins will cause problems in energy metabolism, but having more than is required to run metabolism does not speed it up. Buyers of B-vitamin supplements beware; B vitamins are not stored in the body and all excess will be flushed down the toilet along with the extra money spent. B vitamins are naturally present in numerous foods, and many other foods are enriched with them. In the United States, B-vitamin deficiencies are rare; however in the nineteenth century some vitamin-B deficiencies plagued many people in North America. Niacin deficiency, also known as pellagra, was prominent in poorer Americans whose main dietary staple was refined cornmeal. Its symptoms were severe and included diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and even death. Some of the health consequences of pellagra are the result of niacin being in insufficient supply to support the body’s metabolic functions.\n",

      "➡️ Context: Type 1 Diabetes Type 1 diabetes is a metabolic disease in which insulin-secreting cells in the pancreas are killed by an abnormal response of the immune system, causing a lack of insulin in the body. Its onset typically occurs before the age of thirty. The only way to prevent the deadly symptoms of this disease is to inject insulin under the skin. A person with Type 1 diabetes usually has a rapid onset of symptoms that include hunger, excessive thirst and urination, and rapid weight loss. Because the main function of glucose is to provide energy for the body, when insulin is no longer present there is no message sent to cells to take up glucose from the blood. Instead, cells use fat and proteins to make energy, resulting in weight loss. If Type 1 diabetes goes untreated individuals with the disease will develop a life-threatening condition called ketoacidosis. This condition occurs when the body uses fats and not glucose to make energy, resulting in a build-up of ketone bodies in the blood. It is a severe form of ketosis with symptoms of vomiting, dehydration, rapid breathing, and confusion and eventually coma and death. Upon insulin injection these severe symptoms are treated and death is avoided.\n",

      "➡️ Context: The Digestive System UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM The process of digestion begins even before you put food into your mouth. When you feel hungry, your body sends a message to your brain that it is time to eat. Sights and smells influence your body’s preparedness for food. Smelling food sends a message to your brain. Your brain then tells the mouth to get ready, and you start to salivate in preparation for a meal. Once you have eaten, your digestive system (Figure 2.4 “The Human Digestive System”) starts the process that breaks down the components of food into smaller components that can be absorbed and taken into the body. To do this, the digestive system functions on two levels, mechanically to move and mix ingested food and chemically to break down large molecules. The smaller nutrient molecules can then be absorbed and processed by cells throughout the body for energy  or used as building blocks for new cells. The digestive system is one of the eleven organ systems of the human body, and it is composed of several hollow tube-shaped organs including the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine (colon), rectum, and anus. It is lined with mucosal tissue that secretes digestive juices (which aid in the breakdown of food) and mucus (which facilitates the propulsion of food through the tract).\n",

We previously discussed the general process of food digestion,  let’s follow the specific path that proteins take down the gastrointestinal tract and into the circulatory system (Figure 6.7 “Digestion and Absorption of Protein”). Eggs are a good dietary source of protein and will be used as our example to describe the path of proteins in the processes of digestion and absorption. One egg, whether raw, hard-boiled, scrambled, or fried, supplies about six grams of protein. Figure 6.7 Digestion and Absorption of Protein 378 | Protein Digestion and Absorption\n",

      "➡️ Context: Nutrients Are Essential for Cell and Organ Function When the digestive system has broken down food to its nutrient components, the body eagerly awaits delivery. Water soluble nutrients absorbed into the blood travel directly to the liver via a major blood vessel called the portal vein. One of the liver’s primary functions is to regulate metabolic homeostasis. Metabolic homeostasis is achieved when the nutrients consumed and absorbed match the energy required to carry out life’s biological processes. Simply put, nutrient energy intake equals energy output. Whereas glucose and amino acids are directly transported from the small intestine to the liver, lipids are transported to the liver by a more circuitous route involving the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a one-way system of vessels that transports lymph, a fluid rich in white blood cells, and lipid soluble substances after a meal containing lipids. The lymphatic system slowly moves its contents through the lymphatic vessels and empties into blood vessels in the upper chest area. Now, the absorbed lipid soluble components are in the blood where they can be distributed throughout the body and utilized by cells (see Figure 2.9 “The Absorption of Nutrients”).

      "➡️ Context: Digestion and Absorption of Lipids UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM Lipids are large molecules and generally are not water-soluble. Like carbohydrates and protein, lipids are broken into small components for absorption. Since most of our digestive enzymes are water- based, how does the body break down fat and make it available for the various functions it must perform in the human body? From the Mouth to the Stomach The first step in the digestion of triglycerides and phospholipids begins in the mouth as lipids encounter saliva. Next, the physical action of chewing coupled with the action of emulsifiers enables the digestive enzymes to do their tasks. The enzyme lingual lipase, along with a small amount of phospholipid as an emulsifier, initiates the process of digestion. These actions cause the fats to become more accessible to the digestive enzymes. As a result, the fats become tiny droplets and separate from the watery components.

In ancient Hawai‘i the Hawaiians obtained the majority of their calories from carbohydrate rich plants like the ‘uala (sweet potato), ulu (breadfruit) and kalo (taro). For example, mashed kalo or poi was a staple to meals for Hawaiians. Research suggests that almost 78 percent of the diet was made up of these fiber rich carbohydrate foods.1 Carbohydrates are the perfect nutrient to meet your body’s nutritional needs. They nourish your brain and nervous system, provide energy to all of your cells when within proper caloric limits, and help keep your body fit and lean. Specifically, digestible carbohydrates provide bulk in foods, vitamins, and minerals, while 1. Fujita R, Braun KL, Hughes CK. (2004). The traditional Hawaiian diet: a review of the literature.

The coconut provided wood for shelter and craftsmanship along with being a source of hydration, animal feed and income through copra. It also serves many ecological functions such as a source for shade, protection from the wind, and coastal erosion control.1 A thriving coconut tree provided Pacific Island families with great prosperity. For many Pacific communities the coconut provided a valuable source of fat to a diet that was generally low in fat as the major nutrient found in the mature coconut is fat. As you read further, you will learn the different types of fats, their essential roles in the body, and the potential health consequences and benefits of diets rich in particular lipids. You will be better equipped to decide the best way to get your nutritional punch from various fats in your diet. Lipids are important molecules that serve different roles in the human body.

It pads our hands and buttocks and prevents friction, as these areas frequently come in contact with hard surfaces. It also gives the body the extra padding required when engaging in physically demanding activities such as ice- or roller skating, horseback riding, or snowboarding. Aiding Digestion and Increasing Bioavailability The dietary fats in the foods we eat break down in our digestive systems and begin the transport of precious micronutrients. By carrying fat-soluble nutrients through the digestive process, intestinal absorption is improved. This improved absorption is also known as increased bioavailability. Fat-soluble nutrients are especially important for good health and exhibit a variety of functions. Vitamins A, D, E, and K—the fat-soluble vitamins—are mainly found in foods containing fat. Some fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamin A) are also found in naturally fat-free foods such as green leafy vegetables, carrots, and broccoli.\n",

Some of the remaining indigestible carbohydrates are broken down by enzymes released by bacteria in the large intestine. The products of bacterial digestion of these slow-releasing carbohydrates are short-chain fatty acids and some gases. The short-chain fatty acids are either used by the bacteria to make energy and grow, are eliminated in the feces, or are absorbed into cells of the colon, with a small amount being transported to the liver. Colonic cells use the short-chain fatty acids to support some of their functions. The liver can also metabolize the short-chain fatty acids into cellular energy.

      "- Dietary fiber is categorized as either water-soluble or insoluble. Some examples of soluble fibers are inulin, pectin, and guar gum and they are found in peas, beans, oats, barley, and rye. Cellulose and lignin are insoluble fibers and a few dietary sources of them are whole-grain foods, flax, cauliflower, and avocados. Cellulose is the most abundant fiber in plants, making up the cell walls and providing structure. Soluble fibers are more easily accessible to bacterial enzymes in the large intestine so they can be broken down to a greater extent than insoluble fibers, but even some breakdown of cellulose and other insoluble fibers occurs. The last class of fiber is functional fiber. Functional fibers have been added to foods and have been shown to provide health benefits to humans. Functional fibers may be extracted from plants and purified or synthetically made. An example of a functional fiber is psyllium-seed husk. Scientific studies show that consuming psyllium-seed husk reduces blood-cholesterol levels and this health claim has been approved by the FDA.\n",
      "- Smell and Taste Fat contains dissolved compounds that contribute to mouth- watering aromas and flavors. Fat also adds texture to food. Baked foods are supple and moist. Frying foods locks in flavor and lessens cooking time. How long does it take you to recall the smell of your favorite food cooking?What would a meal be without that savory aroma to delight your senses and heighten your preparedness for eating a meal? Fat plays another valuable role in nutrition. Fat contributes to satiety, or the sensation of fullness. When fatty foods are swallowed the body responds by enabling the processes controlling digestion to retard the movement of food along the digestive tract, thus promoting an overall sense of fullness. Oftentimes before the feeling of fullness arrives, people overindulge in fat-rich foods, finding the delectable taste irresistible.\n",
      "- Digestion and Absorption of Carbohydrates UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM From the Mouth to the Stomach The mechanical and chemical digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth. Chewing, also known as mastication, crumbles the carbohydrate foods into smaller and smaller pieces. The salivary glands in the oral cavity secrete saliva that coats the food particles. Saliva contains the enzyme, salivary amylase. This enzyme breaks the bonds between the monomeric sugar units of disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and starches. The salivary amylase breaks down amylose and amylopectin into smaller chains of glucose, called dextrins and maltose. The increased concentration of maltose in the mouth that results from the mechanical and chemical breakdown of starches in whole grains is what enhances their sweetness. Only about five percent of starches are broken down in the mouth. (This is a good thing as more glucose in the mouth would lead to more tooth decay.)When carbohydrates reach the stomach no further chemical breakdown occurs because the amylase enzyme does not function in the acidic conditions of the stomach.\n",
      "- balance. The discovery of leptin’s functions sparked a craze in the research world and the diet pill industry, as it was hypothesized that if you give leptin to a person who is overweight, they will decrease their food intake. Alas, this is not the case. In several clinical trials it was found that people who are overweight or obese are actually resistant to the hormone, meaning their brain does not respond as well to it.1 Therefore, when you administer leptin to an overweight or obese person there is no sustained effect on food intake. Nutrients themselves also play a role in influencing food intake. The hypothalamus senses nutrient levels in the blood. When they are low the hunger center is stimulated, and when they are high the satiety center is stimulated. Furthermore, cravings for salty and sweet foods have an underlying physiological basis. Both undernutrition and overnutrition affect hormone levels and the neural circuitry controlling appetite, which makes losing or gaining weight a substantial physiological hurdle. Genetic Influences Genetics certainly play a role in body fatness and weight and also affects food intake.\n",
      "- Complex/Slow-Releasing Carbohydrates Complex carbohydrates are polysaccharides, long chains of monosaccharides that may be branched or not branched. There are two main groups of polysaccharides: starches and fibers. Starches Starch molecules are found in abundance in grains, legumes, and root vegetables, such as potatoes. Amylose, a plant starch, is a linear chain containing hundreds of glucose units. Amylopectin, another plant starch, is a branched chain containing thousands of glucose units. These large starch molecules form crystals and are the energy-storing molecules of plants. These two starch molecules (amylose and amylopectin) are contained together in foods, but the smaller one, amylose, is less abundant. Eating raw foods containing starches provides very little energy as the digestive system has a hard time breaking them down. Cooking breaks down the crystal structure of starches, making them much easier to break down in the human body. The starches that remain intact throughout digestion are called resistant starches.\n",

These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage.

Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n",

Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke.

Secondary signs and symptoms include gastric reflux, severe erosion of tooth enamel, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, lacerations in the mouth from vomiting, and peptic ulcers. Repeated damage to the esophagus puts people with bulimia at an increased risk for esophageal cancer. The disorder is also highly genetic, linked to depression and anxiety disorders, and most commonly occurs in adolescent girls and young women. Treatment often involves antidepressant medications and, like anorexia, has better results when both the family and the individual with the disorder participate in nutritional and psychiatric counseling. Binge-Eating Disorder Similar to those who experience anorexia and bulimia, people who have a binge-eating disorder have lost control over their eating. Binge-eating disorder is not currently diagnosed as a distinct psychiatric illness, although there is a proposal from the American Psychiatric Association to categorize it more specifically. People with binge-eating disorder will periodically overeat to the extreme, but their loss of control over eating is not followed by fasting, purging, or compulsive exercise. As a result, people with this disorder are often overweight or obese, and their chronic disease risks are those linked to having an abnormally high body weight such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and Type 2 diabetes. Additionally, they often experience guilt, shame, and depression.\n",

Similarly, depletion of B vitamins will cause problems in energy metabolism, but having more than is required to run metabolism does not speed it up. Buyers of B-vitamin supplements beware; B vitamins are not stored in the body and all excess will be flushed down the toilet along with the extra money spent. B vitamins are naturally present in numerous foods, and many other foods are enriched with them. In the United States, B-vitamin deficiencies are rare; however in the nineteenth century some vitamin-B deficiencies plagued many people in North America. Niacin deficiency, also known as pellagra, was prominent in poorer Americans whose main dietary staple was refined cornmeal. Its symptoms were severe and included diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and even death. Some of the health consequences of pellagra are the result of niacin being in insufficient supply to support the body’s metabolic functions.\n",

      "- by age seventy. Celiac disease is not always diagnosed because the symptoms may be mild. A large number of people have what is referred to as “silent” or “latent” celiac disease. Celiac disease diagnosis requires a blood test and a biopsy of the small intestine. Because celiac disease is an autoimmune disease, antibodies produced by white blood cells circulate in the body and can be detected in the blood. When gluten-containing foods are consumed the antibodies attack cells lining the small intestine leading to a destruction of the small villi projections. This tissue damage can be detected with a biopsy, a procedure that removes a portion of tissue from the damaged organ. Villi destruction is what causes many of the symptoms of celiac disease. The destruction of the absorptive surface of the small intestine also results in the malabsorption of nutrients, so that while people with this disease may eat enough, nutrients do not make it to the bloodstream because absorption is reduced. The effects of nutrient malabsorption are most apparent in children and the elderly as they are especially susceptible to nutrient deficiencies.\n",

      "- milk is the best source to fulfill nutritional requirements. An exclusively breastfed infant does not even need extra water, including in hot climates. A newborn infant (birth to 28 days) requires feedings eight to twelve times a day or more. Between 1 and 3 months of age, the breastfed infant becomes more efficient, and the number of feedings per day often become fewer even though the amount of milk consumed stays the same. After about six months, infants can gradually begin to consume solid foods to help meet nutrient needs. Foods that are added in addition to breastmilk are called complementary foods. Complementary foods should be nutrient dense to provide optimal nutrition. Complementary foods include baby meats, vegetables, fruits, infant cereal, and dairy products such as yogurt, but not infant formula. Infant formula is a substitute, not a complement to breastmilk. In addition to complementary foods, the World Health Organization recommends that breastfeeding continue up to 2 years of age or beyond, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends at least one year of breastfeeding, or longer.\n",
      "- is making sure that children receive an adequate amount of needed nutrients to provide a strong foundation for the rest of their lives. Most expectant mothers begin thinking about how they will feed their baby early in their pregnancy. Therefore, it is important to offer breastfeeding education and support starting with the first prenatal appointment.  Support from family members, especially the baby’s father and grandmother, plus friends, employers, and others can greatly help with both the decision-making process during pregnancy and the beginning and maintenance of breastfeeding after the baby’s birth. In the United States, about 83.2 percent of babies start out being breastfed.1 Yet by the age of six months, when solid foods should begin to be introduced into a child’s diet along with breast milk, only about 25 percent of infants in the United States were still breastfed exclusively, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).2 The approval and assistance of family members, friends, employers, health-care providers, and policymakers can make an enormous difference and provide the needed promotion and support for mothers who wish to breastfeed their children. Education about breastfeeding typically begins with health-care providers. During prenatal care and often soon after a woman has given birth, doctors, nurses, and other clinicians can explain the benefits of breastfeeding and describe the proper technique. Nearly all births in the United States and Canada occur in hospital settings, and hospital practices in labor, delivery, postpartum care, and discharge planning can inform and support women who want to 1. U.

These steps include having a written policy on breastfeeding communicated to health-care staff on a routine basis, informing all new mothers about the benefits and management of breastfeeding, showing new mothers how to breastfeed their infants, and how to maintain lactation, and giving newborns no food or drink other than breast milk, unless medically indicated. Since the BFHI began, more than fifteen thousand facilities in 134 countries, from Benin to Bangladesh, have been deemed “baby friendly.”As a result, more mothers are breastfeeding their newborns and infant health has improved, in both the developed world and in developing nations.22 For information on the Baby-Friendly Initiative in the US, see: https://www.babyfriendlyusa.org. Barriers to Breastfeeding Although breast milk is ideal for almost all infants, there are some challenges that nursing mothers may face when starting and continuing to breastfeed their infants. These obstacles include painful engorgement or fullness in the breasts, often around day 3 to 5 postpartum, sore and tender nipples, lack of comfort or confidence in public, and lack of accommodation to breastfeed or express milk in the workplace.

      "- Most mothers can make enough milk for their babies whether they have small or large breasts. It is normal for a woman to have one breast that is different than the other in size or shape. During pregnancy, the breasts will normally increase in size. If a woman does not notice any changes to her breast during pregnancy, she should discuss this with her healthcare provider or a lactation consultant. After the birth of the baby, nutritional needs must be met to ensure that an infant not only survives, but thrives from infancy into childhood. Breastfeeding provides the fuel a newborn needs for rapid growth and development. As a result, the WHO recommends that breastfeeding is exclusive (no other food or drink) for the first six months of an infant’s life. Exclusive breastfeeding is one of the best ways a mother can support the growth and protect the health of her infant child. Breast milk contains nearly all of the nutrients that a newborn requires and gives a child the best start to a healthy life. Most women want to breastfeed their babies; in the US, over 80% of women start to breastfeed their infants.\n",
      "- caloric content in breast milk is made up of fat. A high-fat diet that includes cholesterol is necessary to support the development of neural pathways in the brain and throughout the body. However, saturated fats and trans fatty acids inhibit this growth. Infants who are over the age of six months, which means they are receiving complementary foods, should not consume foods that are high in these types of fats. The RDA (AI) for total fat is 30 grams per day for infants 0-6 months old and 31 grams per day for infants 7-12 months old. Micronutrients Almost all of the nutrients that infants require during the first 6 months can be met if they consume an adequate amount of breast milk. There are a few exceptions, though. Unless the mother is taking a large dose of Vitamin D, human milk will be low in vitamin D, which is needed for calcium absorption and building bone, among other things. Therefore, breastfed children often need to take a vitamin D supplement in the form of drops. Infants at the highest risk for vitamin D deficiency are those with darker skin and little to no exposure to sunlight, and infants born prematurely.\n",

      "Example 1:\n",
      "Query: What are the fat-soluble vitamins?\n",
      "Answer: The fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example 2:\n",
      "Query: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\n",
      "Answer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example 3:\n",
      "Query: What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?\n",
      "Answer: Hydration is crucial for physical performance because water plays key roles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke. Drinking sufficient water before, during, and after exercise helps ensure peak physical performance and recovery.\n",

      "- Vitamin D’s Functional Role Activated vitamin D3 (calcitriol) regulates blood calcium levels in concert with parathyroid hormone. In the absence of an adequate intake of vitamin D, less than 15 percent of calcium is absorbed from foods or supplements. The effects of calcitriol on calcium homeostasis are critical for bone health. A deficiency of vitamin D in children causes the bone disease nutritional rickets. Rickets is very common among children in developing countries and is characterized by soft, weak, deformed bones that are exceptionally susceptible to fracture. In adults, vitamin D deficiency causes a similar disease called osteomalacia, which is characterized by low BMD. Osteomalacia has the same symptoms and consequences as osteoporosis and often coexists with osteoporosis. Vitamin D deficiency is common, especially in the elderly population, dark- skinned populations, and in the many people who live in the northern latitudes where sunlight exposure is much decreased during the long winter season.

      "- This highly toxic chemical can cause mercury poisoning, which leads to developmental problems in children, as well as autoimmune effects. A condition called Minamata disease was identified in 1956 in Japan. It was named for the town of Minamata, which was the site of an environmental disaster when methyl mercury was released into the surface water near a factory. Many residents experienced neurological issues, including numbness in hands and feet, muscle weakness, a narrowing of the field of vision, damage to hearing and speech, and ataxia, which is a lack of muscle coordination.8 8. Minamata Disease: The History and Measures.

      "- Symptoms could include nerve dysfunction, such as double vision, inability to swallow, speech difficulty, and progressive paralysis of the respiratory system. Botulism can also be fatal. Campylobacter jejuni causes the disease campylobacteriosis. It is the most commonly identified bacterial cause of diarrhea worldwide. Consuming undercooked chicken, or food contaminated with the juices of raw chicken, is the most frequent source of this infection. Other sources include raw meat and unpasteurized milk. Within two to five days after consumption, symptoms can begin and include diarrhea, stomach cramps, fever, and bloody stools. The duration of this disease is about seven to ten days. The food infection shigellosis is caused by Shigella, of which there are several types. Sources include undercooked liquid or moist food Prevention.\n",
      "- Image by Allison Calabrese / CC BY 4.0 Parasitic Protozoa Food-contaminating parasitic protozoa are microscopic organisms that may be spread in food and water. Several of these creatures pose major problems to food production worldwide. They include Anisakis, microscopic worms that invade the stomach or the intestines. Sources of this parasite include raw fish. This parasite can result in the Anisakis infection, with symptoms that begin within a day or less and include abdominal pain, which can be severe. Cryptosporidium lives in the intestines of infected animals. Another common source is drinking water, when heavy rains wash animal wastes into reservoirs. One major problem with this pathogen is that it is extremely resistant to disinfection with chlorine. Cryptosporidium causes the disease cryptosporidiosis, with symptoms that begin one to twelve days after exposure and include watery stools, loss of appetite, vomiting, a low-grade fever, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. For HIV/AIDS patients and others with weakened immune systems, the disease can be severe, and sometimes can lead to death.\n",
      "- Image by Allison Calabrese / CC BY 4.0   Iron Toxicity The body excretes little iron and therefore the potential for accumulation in tissues and organs is considerable. Iron accumulation in certain tissues and organs can cause a host of health problems in children and adults including extreme fatigue, arthritis, joint pain, and severe liver and heart toxicity. In children, death has occurred from ingesting as little as 200 mg of iron and therefore it is critical to keep iron supplements out of children’s reach. The IOM has set tolerable upper intake levels of iron (Table 11.2 “Dietary Reference Intakes for Iron”). Mostly a hereditary disease, hemochromatosis is the result of a genetic mutation that leads to abnormal iron metabolism and an accumulation of iron in certain tissues such as the liver, pancreas, and heart. The signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis are similar to those of iron overload 658 | Iron\n",

The increase in spine curvature not only causes pain, but also decreases a person’s height. Curvature of the upper spine produces what is called Dowager’s hump, also known as kyphosis. Severe upper-spine deformity can compress the chest cavity and cause difficulty breathing. It may also cause abdominal pain and loss of appetite because of the increased pressure on the abdomen. 1090 | Nutrition, Health and Disease\n",

How is that water replaced in these organs?What happens to the water now in the intestines?In a day, there is an exchange of about 10 liters of water among the body’s organs. The osmoregulation of this exchange involves complex communication between the brain, kidneys, and endocrine system.

These abbreviations refer to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), respectively. Lipoproteins are characterized by size, density, and composition. As the size of the lipoprotein increases, the density decreases. This means that HDL is smaller than LDL.
